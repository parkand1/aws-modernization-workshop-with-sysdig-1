It is extremely important to maintain a high level of security in your entire application environment. Not doing so can result in your system being compromised. This can incur significant costs and can lead to commercial & business issues, and failed compliance tests leading to a loss of trust with customers and monetary fines and/or settlement fees.  

In a cloud native environment, the security of your application is dependent largely upon the security of your containers, but not exclusively - it also depends upon the infrastructure upon which it runs.

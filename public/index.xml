      <description>Sysdig Secure provides a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance and compliance across your application&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem. One critical part of this is scanning the images in your registry.
Sysdig’s ImageVision technology identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations by automating scanning within CI/CD pipelines and registries, as well as implementing registry scanning inline. It also blocks vulnerabilities pre-production, monitors for new CVEs at runtime, and helps you map a critical vulnerability back to an application and dev team.</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/00_introduction/04_inline_scanning.html</guid>
      <description>There are two general approaches to scanning images in Sysdig - backend scanning or inline scanning. The reasons why you might choose one over the other is best explained by an understanding of how scanning works under the hood.
-- With Sysdig, there are two phases in scanning an image
 Analysis of contents Evaluation against policies and vulnerabilities  Phase 1 - Analysis of Contents During the analysis phase of the scan, the worker first loads the image.</description>

      <description>In the same way image scanning gives you visibility of vulnerabilities and threats pertaining specifically to an application&amp;rsquo;s containers, infrastructure scanning gives visibility of potential issues emanating from the environment on which these containers run.
AWS provides a rich environment upon which to base your application, but it&amp;rsquo;s not without its risks. There are many places where bad actors can create harm, for example exposing data by making S3 buckets public, deleting bucket encryption, disabling MFA for an account, adding/removing IAM policies.</description>

      <description>AWS Fargate and ECS allow you to deploy containerized workloads quickly. Those services are so convenient that many people leave them unattended, risking exposure to vulnerabilities inside their containers that can exfiltrate secrets, compromise business data, impact performance, and increase their AWS costs.
For example, think of some credentials mistakenly included in an image, later deployed on Fargate. They will be exposed to anyone with access to the image (think on the repository), or to the Fargate service.</description>

      <description>AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that Let’s you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don’t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.
We will use Amazon Cloud9 to access our AWS account via the AWS CLI in this Workshop.</description>

      <description>For the purposes of this lab you need to create an Amazon ECR registry. To do this, follow the steps below
 Log into your Cloud9 Workspace
 Run the following command to create a repository. The name is arbitrary, but for continuity in the lab please use aws-workshop
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name aws-workshop --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true The output will be as follows
{ &amp;#34;repository&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;repositoryArn&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:845151661675:repository/aws-workshop&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;registryId&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;845151661675&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;repositoryName&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;aws-workshop&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;repositoryUri&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;845151661675.</description>

      <description>This integration enables the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to automatically trigger an action to scan every new container that is pushed into the registry.
 Log into your AWS Console and select &amp;lsquo;US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1&amp;rsquo; from the &amp;lsquo;Select a Region&amp;rsquo; dropdown on the top right.
For the purposes of this exercise we will be using AWS Region us-east-1

      <description>Download Example Dockerfile and Sources Now that our automatic scanner is in place, we can test it by pushing a Docker container, and check if it scans.
To illustrate the images scanning we will build an example Node.JS application based on the official “hello world” example described in their website.
 Go to your Cloud9 Workspace and download and uncompress example container files
wget https://github.com/sysdiglabs/hello-world-node-vulnerable/releases/download/v1.0/hello-world-node-vulnerable.zip unzip hello-world-node-vulnerable.zip cd hello-world-node-vulnerable/ And build and push the image to ECR</description>

 Go back into Cloud9 Workspace
 As a bit of housekeeping, first lets delete the older node image as follows to free up space on our cloud9 workstation,
docker rmi $(docker images | grep node | grep -v lambda | awk &amp;#39;{print $3}&amp;#39;) Edit the Dockerfile and in the first line update the base image from</description>

      <description>In this module we saw how to use Sysdig&amp;rsquo;s AWS ECR integration to automatically scan images upon being added to Amazon ECR.
In particular we looked at how to deploy the Amazon ECR Integration using AWS CloudFormation template. Then we saw how to setup the Amazon ECR Registry and push images to the it and observe them being scanned.
Finally we looked at how to view the scan results on the Sysdig Secure dashboard.</description>

      <description>We will use the Amazon ECS CLI tool to deploy an example ECS cluster, so we&amp;rsquo;ll need to install it on our Cloud9 Workspace. To install Amazon ECS CLI, follow the steps below
 Log into your Cloud9 Workspace
 Download the Amazon ECS CLI binary and make it executable .
sudo curl -sLo /usr/local/bin/ecs-cli https://amazon-ecs-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-cli-linux-amd64-latest sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ecs-cli Check installation
ecs-cli --version Now create a file named task-execution-assume-role.json for our IAM role as follows</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/40_module_2/41_deploy_image_scanner_for_fargate.html</guid>
      <description>To deploy the Sysdig image scanner for Fargate, we&amp;rsquo;ll again use Amazon CloudFormation. The procedure is identical to how we installed Amazon ECR Integration in the previous lab, so this time we&amp;rsquo;ll use the AWS CLI instead.
Note You can find instructions on using the CLI on the Sysdig Fargate scanning installation page
 First, make sure your Sysdig SecureAPIToken and SecureEndpoint environment variables are set.
echo $SecureAPIToken echo $SecureEndpoint You should have set these environment variables when setting up your Cloud9 Workspace.</description>

 Create a cluster configuration and create a cluster

      <description>In this module we saw how to use Sysdig&amp;rsquo;s AWS ECS/Fargate integration to automatically scan deployed images.
We first deployed Sysdig&amp;rsquo;s AWS ECS/Fargate integration using a CloudFormation template.
In particular we looked at how to deploy the Amazon ECR Integration. Then we deployed an ECS cluster using Fargate and watched as CodeBuild pipelines are automatically created to scan the images.
Finally we saw how to view the scan results on the Sysdig Secure dashboard.</description>

 Log into Cloud9 Workspace
S3 bucket names are globally unique, so use your initials in lower case combined with a timestamp
 First set your initials as an environment variable

Using Sysdig CloudConnector, you are not limited to the out-of-the-box rules provided. You can modify existing rules, or write your own tailored to your own needs.

Letâ€™s try first modifying a rule. The following rule checks if a resource is created in a region that you are not usually using. But to be active, you have to specify which regions you want to detect.


```
- list: disallowed_aws_regions
  items: []

- rule: AWS command executed on unused region
  desc: Detect AWS command execution on unused regions
  condition:
    not jevt.value[/errorCode] exists and
    jevt.value[/awsRegion] in (disallowed_aws_regions)
  output:
    An AWS command has been executed on an unused region
    (requesting user=%jevt.value[/userIdentity/arn],
     requesting IP=%jevt.value[/sourceIPAddress],
     AWS region=%jevt.value[/awsRegion]
  priority: CRITICAL
  tags: [cloud, source=cloudtrail, aws, NIST800_53, NIST800_53_AC-2(12)(b)]
  source: k8s_audit
```


_[Include here instructions on how to download and update rules files when that mechanism is implemented]_

1. For the *disallowed_aws_regions* list, edit the items to include **us-west-1** and **us-west-2**:

```
- list: disallowed_aws_regions
  items: [us-west-1, us-west-2]
```


_[Instructions to update and reload rules]_

2. Now we create a new log group on **us-west-2**

```
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name "test_unused_region" --region="us-west-2"
    ```

CloudTrail takes up to 10 minutes to provide the events. When the event is available, CloudConnector will trigger the rule and we will see a new security finding appear in AWS Security Hub.

_[Introduce screenshots when rule update process is available]_
